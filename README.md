# IST256 Spring 2016 Exam Problem Set 2

## What is this exactly?
Exam Problem Sets are a series of coding exercises which help prepare you for the in-class examination. They should be used as a compliment to your studies, not a replacement for them. The guiding principle should be if you can complete these Java programs successfully, **and** understand how the code you wrote works, then you will be well prepared for the exam.

Since these problem sets only serve as a study guide, they are not graded. Therefore you may work with others on the problem set exercises as you would if you formed a study group.  Use these problem sets as a measuring stick of your knowledge; to assess your comfort level with the material and as a guide to determine whether you require remedial help prior to the actual exam.

### Downloading these exercises

Click the **Download ZIP** button on this page to download the code to your computer. After you download the code, right-click on the file and select **Extract All...** to unzip it.

There are 3 NetBeans Projects in this problem set. Open them as you would any other class programming activity. Instructions for each project are in the main Java file.

## About the Exam ##
### What lessons are covered in this exam?
This exam covers **lessons 06 - 11** on our syllabus. Here's an abridged list of the key takeaways from these lessons:
- Methods. How to define them, implement them in code, and call (invoke) them. Identifying the inputs and outputs of a method from its signature. Return statement.
- Constructor methods of classes. The constructor is responsible for setting up the data in the method by assigning input arguments to private members of the class.
- Objects and Classes. Given a class file with empty methods, can you implement the methods including the constructor. Can you, from another class, create objects and call methods?
- Unit Testing and Java Docs. What is the purpose of a unit test? Why is automated testing important? What are the three steps of every unit test? If the set is setup correctly but fails, where is the error? You should know how to write a unit test when given the name of the test, and how to use a failing test to troubleshoot method code.
- If statement. Know all the forms of the if statement, and when it is appropriate to use each. if, if...else, if else if ladder. Logical operators, and, or and not.
- Switch statement. How does it work? When to use switch versus if? What does break do in the switch statement?
- For loop. Know the three elements of a for loop. Start, Stop and Increment / Decrement. Understand the Increment / Decrement operators. Write loops to work in various ways.
- While loops. Pre-test, post-test, mid-test loops. Using break to force an exit condition. Sentinel controlled loops. When to use for versus when to use while.
- Code tracing. You should be able to trace code using all the constructs discussed above.
- Code writing. The code writing assignment stops at lesson 10. No lesson 11 stuff on the code writing assignment. You will have to use a Java Class in the code writing assignment.

### What to bring to the exam
- 1 sheet of 8.5 x 11 inch paper with whatever you want on it. Personal notes, stuff from the web, a photo of your professor, etc.
- A couple of pens or pencils. (Its a paper exam.)
