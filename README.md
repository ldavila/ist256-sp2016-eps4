## A Different Approach

This exam problem set it worth 5 points towards your exam. **For credit, you must complete it before the exam and bring it with you when you take the exam.**
This time I don't want you to hand-write the code but work on it in netbeans, and provide me a print out of your code that you will bring to the exam.
Make sure your name is on the print out as a Java comment. **You'll get a zero if you hand write your name on the printout because I have no way to verify its your code.**
