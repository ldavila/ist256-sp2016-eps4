# IST256 Spring 2016 Exam Problem Set 3

## What is this exactly?
Exam Problem Sets are a series of coding exercises which help prepare you for the in-class examination. They should be used as a compliment to your studies, not a replacement for them. The guiding principle should be if you can complete these Java programs successfully, **and** understand how the code you wrote works, then you will be well prepared for the exam.

Since these problem sets only serve as a study guide, they are not graded. Therefore you may work with others on the problem set exercises as you would if you formed a study group.  Use these problem sets as a measuring stick of your knowledge; to assess your comfort level with the material and as a guide to determine whether you require remedial help prior to the actual exam.

### Downloading these exercises

Click the **Download ZIP** button on this page to download the code to your computer. After you download the code, right-click on the file and select **Extract All...** to unzip it.

There are 3 NetBeans Projects in this problem set. Open them as you would any other class programming activity. Instructions for each project are in the main Java file.

## About the Exam ##
### What lessons are covered in this exam?
This exam covers **lessons 11 - 14** on our syllabus. Here's an abridged list of the key takeaways from these lessons:
- You should have a solid base knowledge of everything we've covered in the previous lessons **Lessons 01-10**
- While loops. Pre-test, post-test, mid-test loops. Using break to force an exit condition. Sentinel controlled loops. When to use for versus when to use while. No code traces.
- Arrays. Single dimension, multi-dimension. Arrays of base types (int, double, String, boolean) and of object types.
- Enumerating arrays with a for loop, including the for each syntax. Enumerating a 2-dimensional array, like in the tic-tac-toe example.
- ArrayLists. Understanding the methods of an ArrayList class (add, clear, clone, get, remove, set )
- Code tracing. You should be able to trace code using all the constructs discussed above.
- Code writing.

### What to bring to the exam
