# IST256 Spring 2016 Exam Problem Set 1

## What is this exactly?
Exam Problem Sets are a series of coding exercises which help prepare you for the in-class examination. They should be used as a compliment to your studies, not a replacement for them. The guiding principle should be if you can complete these Java programs successfully, and understand how the code you wrote works, then you will be well prepared for the exam.

Since these problem sets only serve as a study guide, they are not graded. Therefore you may work with others on the problem set exercises as you would if you formed a study group.  Use these problem sets as a measuring stick of your knowledge; to assess your level of comfort with the material and as a guide to seek help prior to the actual exam. If you're having difficulty, its a sign you need remedial help - you should seek office hours and review class video, readings and coding activities with greater depth.

## About the Exam ##
### What lessons are covered in this exam?
This exam covers **lessons 01 - 05** on our syllabus. Here's an abridged list of the key takeaways from these lessons:
- Understanding the differences between a source file and class file; Understanding the associations between a java class in your source file and the name of the file. Java packages.
- Basic input and output ```print(), println() and printf()``` using the ```Scanner``` class and its methods to get input ``` nextLine(), nextInt(), nextDouble()``` etc...
- variables, assignment and data types. What is variable assignment (how does it work... what's really happening)? Data types ```int, char, double, boolean, String``` Format codes for ```printf()``` statement to output variables of different data types ``` %d %f %s```.
- Arithmetic operators ``` + - * / % ``` etc... Operators behave differently depending on data type, for example ``` + ``` means something else when the operands are two strings. Operators preserve data type (e.g. ``` 5/2 ``` equals ``` 2 ``` not ``` 2.5 ```).
- Type promotion / Implicit type casting: Operands of mixed type are promoted to the more complex type. Explicit type casting: Forcing a complex type to a simpler type.  
- Data conversion: Parsing strings to Integer or Double
- The "inline if" Operator: ``` ? : ``` to evaluate a boolean expression to a value
- Various kinds of programming errors: Syntax, Semantic / Logic, Runtime.
- Concepts of Objects and Classes. Understanding a constructor statement, example: ``` Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in) ```. Knowing where the object, class, constructor and arugments are located in any constructor statement.
- Using other classes like ``` Random, Math, StringBuilder ``` or any custom class.
- Understanding how to construct objects and call methods from from a custom class.
- Creating your own methods. What is a method? Why do we use them?
- Understanding the anatomy of a Java method: (input arguments, output return Type). Implicit assignment (values of arguments are assigned to variables in method)
- You should be able to trace through java code to determine what it is doing.
- You should be able to spot syntax or logic errors in Java code.

### What to bring to the exam
