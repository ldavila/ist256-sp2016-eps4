/************************
* 1.3 - Coin Flip
* 
* This program evaluates your ability to use a Java class that someone else wrote.
* Testing your ability to create objects and call methods. Use String methods like
* String.equals to compare two strings.
* 
* TASK: 
* Write a program to simulate the flip of TWO coins, print out the values of both coins and
* state whether they are the same. this program takes no input, it just displays 
* output based on the coin flips.  Just use the Coin
* class I've created.
* Here's a code outline:
* 1) Create an object of class Coin, called coin1
* 2) Create an object of class Coin, called coin2
* 3) Flip coin1
* 4) Flip coin2
* 5) Print the face of coin1 and coin2
* 6) Use Inline If :? to print if the coins are the same.
* 
* SAMPLE RUN #1:
* Coin 1 ==> HEADS
* Coin 2 ==> TAILS
* Result ==> NOT THE SAME
*
* SAMPLE RUN #2:
* Coin 1 ==> HEADS
* Coin 2 ==> HEADS
* Result ==> SAME
*
* NOTES:
* make sure you use the methods on the Coin class. 
* Don't write your own code to flip coins... use mine!
