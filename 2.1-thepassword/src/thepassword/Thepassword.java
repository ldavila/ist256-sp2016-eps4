/************************
* 2.1 - The Password
* 
* This program evaluates your ability to use a for loop and if statement.
* It does not involve any custom classes or unit tests. 
* 
* 
* TASK: 
* Write a program to use a for loop to give you three attempts at entering a 
* correct password. If you enter the correct password print "Password Accepted"
* Each time you enter the incorrect password it should print "Incorrect Password"
* If you fail to enter the correct password 3 times it should print "Locked Out"
* The password, of course is "rhubarb"
* 
* Here's an algorithm for the main() method:
* 
* loop 3 times:
*   print "Enter Password"
*   password = input from user
*   if password equals "rhubarb" then 
*       we have success
*       quit the loop
*   else
*       print "Incorrect Password"
* end loop
* 
* if we have success then
*   print "Password Accepted"
* else
*   print "Locked Out"
