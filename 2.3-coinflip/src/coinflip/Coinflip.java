/************************
* 2.3 - Tracking Coin Flips
* 
* This program evaluates your ability to use a Java class that someone else wrote.
* It will also test your ability to use a for loop and if else statement.
* 
* 
* TASK: 
* Write a program to ask the user how many times they would like to flip a coin,
* then output the number of head and tails. 
* 
* Here's the algorithm for main():
*  number_of_heads = 0
*  number_of_tails = 0
*  print "How many times do you want to flip the coin?"
*  flips = get input from user
*  loop from 1 to flips:
*    flip the coin, store the result
*    if the coin flip is heads:
*       add one to number_of_heads
*    else
*       add one to number_of_tails
*  end loop
* 
*  print "Heads:" + number_of_heads
*  print "Tails:" + number_of_tails
* 
* 
* SAMPLE OUTPUT:
* 
* How many times do you want to flip the coin? 1000
* 
* Results:
* HEADS: 524
* TAILS: 476
