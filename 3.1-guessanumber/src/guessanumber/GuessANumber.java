* 3.2 - Calculating quiz avergae
* 
* This program evaluates your ability to use a a for loop with an array.
* It does not involve any custom classes or unit tests. 
* 
* TASK: 
* Professor Charles Xavier issues 5 quizzes to his "gifted" students. Your
* job is to write a program which inputs the 5 exam scores, storing them in an 
* array, then computes the average of the quiz scores.
* 
* SAMPLE RUN:
* Quiz #1: 8
* Quiz #1: 7
* Quiz #1: 8
* Quiz #1: 9
* Quiz #1: 5
* Average: 7.4
* 
* ALGORITHM: 
* Here's a step-by-step algorithm for the main() method:
* 
* quiz = array of 5 integers
* loop 5 times
*   print "Quiz # "
*   quiz index = input from user
* end loop
* 
* sum = 0
* loop 5 times:
*   sum = sum + quiz index
* end loop
* print  "Average" : sum divided by 5
*
