* This program evaluates your ability to perform basic input / output and use 
* variables, operators and the printf() function to format output. 
* 
* TASK: 
* Write a program to ask for an occupation and hourly wage, then displays the
* input as output along with how much the occupation makes in a year, 
* assuming we work 2000 hours in a single year.
* 
* SAMPLE RUN #1:
* Enter an occupation name ==> Software Engineer
* Enter the hourly rage for occupation 'Software Engineer' ==> 45.50
* The occupation Software Engineer makes $45.50/hr. That's $91000.00/year!
*
* SAMPLE RUN #2:
* Enter an occupation name ==> Plumber
* Enter the hourly rage for occupation 'Plumber' ==> 19.75
* The occupation Plumber makes $19.75/hr. That's $39500.00/year!
*
* NOTES:
* Get the output to display exactly as shown. use printf() format codes.
