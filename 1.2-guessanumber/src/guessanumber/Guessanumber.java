/************************
* 1.2 - Guess a number
* 
* This program evaluates your ability to use another class (Random) as well as use
* the inline if operator ? :  to make simple decisions. 
* 
* TASK: 
* Write a program to play a number guessing game:
* 1) ask you for a number > 1. (don't worry about bad input) 
* 2) store your input in a variable, let's call it max
* 3) generate a random number between 1 and max, store it in a variable number
* 4) ask you to guess a number between 1 and max, store it in variable guess
* 5) use ? : to figure out if the guess is RIGHT or WRONG, store in a string variable
* 4) Print out the random number and whether you guesses right (the string variable)
* 
* SAMPLE RUN #1:
* Enter an integer bigger than 1 ==> 5
* Guess a number between 1 and 5 ==> 3
* The number was 3. You guessed RIGHT!
*
* SAMPLE RUN #2:
* Enter an integer bigger than 1 ==> 3
* Guess a number between 1 and 4 ==> 3
* The number was 2. You guessed WRONG!
*
* NOTES:
* Each time you run the program it should play a new game with different guesses
* Use the inline if :? operator to assign right or wrong based on guess == number
