/*  4.1 Registered students!

This program should read a data file named coursereg.txt consisting 
of courses and registered students (enrollments), formatted as follows:

EXAMPLE:

IST195,120
IST233,135
IST256,65
IST359,94

It should parse each line and read it into an array list of Registration 
(class included in the package), similar to the example we did in class. 
After you read the file into the array list, you should then determine 
the course with the most  registered students by looping over the array list.

For example, based on the EXAMPLE: above the output should be like this:

Highest enrollment: IST233 with 135 students.

HANDING IT IN:

This part of the exam is take home. You must complete it BEFORE the exam
and turn it in before the exam begins.

TIP: This is similar to the example we did in class. My solution has 18 lines 
of code in the main method, so there's not a lot of typing here.
